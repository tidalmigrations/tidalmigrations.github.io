# Conclusion

Immediately getting an idea of the size and scope of your migration is critical
to successful cloud migration planning.

Our goal at Tidal is to provide you with useful information within
60 seconds of signup, and letting you layer in additional information from
discovery sources as needed.

_You do not need to spend weeks and months installing discovery systems to
start planning your cloud migration any more._
