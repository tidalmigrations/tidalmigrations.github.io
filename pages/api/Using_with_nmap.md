You can send the output generated by Nmap to the Tidal API in two ways. First, by using Tidal Tools [Instructions](https://guides.tidalmg.com/host-discovery.html) and second, by sending the data to the API by using a service like Postman. 
You can find detailed instructions for how to use Postman for authentication and CRUD operations [here](https://guides.tidalmg.com/postman_docs.html).

{% include callout.html content="A downside of this approach is that you will
have to create the expected JSON payload required by the API to handle the
request." type="primary" %}
 
Once you are authenticated and set up,  you can use this API endpoint to capture your Nmap output.
 
` POST /nmap`
 
 
 
This is the shape of the expected payload.
 
```
{
  "nmap_output": {
    "hosts": [
      {
        "ip_address" : "32.199.2.33",
        "ptr_record": "abc-32-199-2-33.cloudfront.net",
        "ports": [
          {
            "port": 22,
            "protocol": "tcp",
            "status": "open",
            "service": {
              "name": "openssh",
              "version": "1.1"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

{% include note.html content="Send a JSON file with [Tidal Tools](https://guides.tidalmg.com/host-discovery.html) by using the `--json` flag. 
For example, `tidal sync nmap --json /path/to/nmap.json`" %}

You could also use cURL, a request would look similar to this:
 
```
export API_TOKEN=PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
export SUBDOMAIN=PUT_YOUR_SUBDOMAIN_HERE

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data @nmap_out.json \
"https://$SUBDOMAIN.tidalmg.com/api/v1/nmap"
```
