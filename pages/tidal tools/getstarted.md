Here we outline how to get started working with Tidal Tools via the command
line.

## Downloading & Installing {#install}

Tidal Tools is a cross platform CLI utility that you can use to discover and
analyze your applications. [Easily install Tidal Tools](https://get.tidal.sh)
on your operating system.

### Dependencies

If you plan to use the `tidal analyze code` command to analyze your source code
or `tidal analyze db` to analyze your databases, you will need to install
Docker Community Edition. To install Docker on your system you can check
[Docker's documentation directly](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Once
installed you can [verify it is installed and working
correctly](/troubleshooting.html) with the command `tidal doctor`.

Docker for Windows supports both Linux containers and Windows containers,
however **Tidal Tools works when your Docker installation is set to to use
Linux containers**. [Set up Docker for Windows to use Linux
containers](/troubleshooting.html#docker-linux-containers).

## Using Tidal Tools

To get started, from a new terminal or Powershell prompt, simply run:

```
tidal
```

To see what you can do with the tidal checkout some of our other articles about
creating sync jobs or analyzing your applications via their URLs.

## Connecting to the API

Once you have Tidal Tools installed you need to configure access to the API.
[Register for a free account](https://get.tidalmg.com/) with Tidal Migrations
to get the connection details.

There are several ways to authenticate with the Tidal Migrations API, we
recommend the first one, `tidal login`, because your password is never
persisted to disk.

### Tidal Login command {#login}

To authenticate with the API type `tidal login` and follow the prompts. This
should provide and store an access token for you that gives you access for 8
hours. Once it is expired, the user must login again and obtain another token.

**We recommend that you utilise this command because it doesn't store your
password.** If you must store the password, you can authenticate using the
methods below.

### Alternative authentication methods

#### Configuration file

Alternatively, you can use the `tidal config` command to manually set your
credentials.

For example, you can set your username, password and URL with the three
following commands:

```
tidal config set tidal.email [set your email]
tidal config set tidal.password [set your password]
tidal config set tidal.url https://demo.tidalmg.com
```

Your credentials will be stored in a configuration file such as:

```
tidal:
  email: my_user_name_here
  password: my_secure_password_here
  url: https://my_instance_name_here.tidalmg.com
```

On macOS the config file is located:
`$HOME/Library/Preferences/tidal/config.yaml`

On Linux systems it is: `$HOME/.config/tidal/config.yaml`

And on Windows it is: `%AppData%\tidal\config.yaml`

#### Environment Variables

You can specify your credentials as environment variables. If so, these
variables need to be set:

- `TIDAL_EMAIL`
- `TIDAL_PASSWORD`
- `TIDAL_URL`

#### Dynamically

Alternatively you can pass in your credentials on each request as command line
arguments using the following flags:

```
--tidal-email youremail@address.here
--tidal-password your_secure_password
--tidal-url https://yoursubdomain.tidalmg.com
```

## Testing connectivity and authentication

Once you have set your credentials you can test your connectivity and
authentication to the API with the ping command:

```
tidal ping
```

### Using a Proxy

If you need to use a proxy, you can specify it with the `https_proxy` variable.

On macOS and Linux you would run:

```
export https_proxy=1.1.1.1:123
```

and on Windows:

```
set https_proxy=1.1.1.1:123
```

Of course replacing `1.1.1.1` with your proxy IP address and `123` with the
port number.

Once you have this set, you should be able to run `tidal ping` successfully.
Remember that you will need to set this for every new terminal session you
start.
