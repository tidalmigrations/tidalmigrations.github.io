## Why am I not receiving verification or invite emails?

It is possible the emails are being blocked by your spam or filtering system. If you are using Microsoft Office 365 for your email service, either online at https://outlook.office365.com/mail/ or in an email client, we suggest you check both your spam folder and the ['quarantine'](https://protection.office.com/quarantine).
