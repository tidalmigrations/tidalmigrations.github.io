## Overview

Getting an accurate view of your infrastructure needs is useful when planning a
cloud migration.  Most datacenter operations groups have a good view of their
overall storage utilization from various SAN and virtualization management
tools, but relying on these aggregated data points often causes teams to
underestimate the storage needs of their applications in the cloud.

When taking an _application-centric_ approach to cloud migration, getting the
resource utilization from each individual server gives you a more accurate view
of each application's resource requirements in the cloud and ignores the
trickery of thin-provisioning from SAN tools.  This allows you to confidently
plan data replication time, or other migration metrics on an app-by-app basis.

{% include tip.html content="As your cloud migration will likely take place
over many months or years, it's important to have current resource requirements
throughout your journey. To accomplish this, setup `machine_stats` in a cron
job or Scheduled Task and synchronize your data on a _daily_ basis to Tidal
Migrations." %}

## Windows

### Introduction

Machine Stats for Windows is a simple and effective way to gather machine stats (RAM, Storage, CPU) from a Windows Server environment. 
For the best possible results, we recommend using it with [WinRM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/installation-and-configuration-for-windows-remote-management)
to `Invoke-Command` across your servers.

If WinRM is not the ideal solution for you, we offer an alternative approach backed by WMI. See [this section](#gather-machine-stats-without-winrm) for more information.

Machine Stats for Windows outputs JSON data, which can be saved and uploaded to the Tidal Migrations Platform, or piped there directly using Tidal Tools.

### Requirements and Dependencies

Prior to the steps on syncing your hypervisors, be sure to have the below
dependencies setup:

- To get started you will need to have Tidal Tools installed. You can check out
  [Getting Started with Tidal Tools](tidal-tools.html) guide on how to install
  it.
- To gather additional data, such as CPU utilization and process stats, you
  will need [WinRM
enabled](https://support.auvik.com/hc/en-us/articles/204424994-How-to-enable-WinRM-with-domain-controller-Group-Policy-for-WMI-monitoring)
  across your environment for this.
- The scripts needed for this process can be found in [Machine Stats for
  Windows GitHub
repository](https://github.com/tidalmigrations/machine_stats/tree/master/windows).

### Running the Script

{% include note.html content="Be sure to set PowerShell's Execution policy to
execute this script before running it. [This
guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2)
will help you in doing so." %}

1. To start, run the script `.\save_password.ps1` and enter your password when
   prompted. This will save your credentials securely in a text file.

2. Save a list of the server hostnames that you would like to sync in a file.
   By default, Machine Stats script will search for file called `servers.txt`
   in the current folder. If a list was saved in some other file, you can specify
   its path using the `-ServersPath` parameter for `runner.ps1` script.

3. Run the script `.\runner.ps1`. It will prompt for username. Alternatively,
   you can specify the username using the `-UserName` parameter. The data of
   the list of servers will be shown as a JSON.

4. You can pipe the output of the Machine Stats script directly to the Tidal
   Tools: `.\runner.ps1 | tidal sync servers`

{% include note.html content="We recommend that you set this script to run
periodically so that your servers are synced on a daily basis and the
data is up to date. Here is an [example](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/taskschd/daily-trigger-example--scripting-)
of a scripting task in PowerShell that runs daily."%}

And there you have it! Your servers will be synced to Tidal Migrations.

### Gather Machine Stats Without WinRM

By default, Machine Stats for Windows uses WinRM to connect to and read data from your machines. If you need to gather machine stats from a non-WinRM environment, we offer an alternative approach backed by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

Using this approach, you will not be able to gather stats on running processes with the `-ProcessStats` flag. You will also not be able to gather peak and average CPU utilization over time. What you can capture is general machine information, as well as point-in-time CPU utilization using the `-CPUUtilizationOnlyValue` flag.

__Requirements__
- Your controller and subject machines should be on the same network, and you should populate the `servers.txt` file with the private IP addresses of your subject machines.
- Your subject machines should have the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) firewall rule group enabled. You can enable this with the following command:
  ```
  netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)" new enable=yes
  ```

After satisfying the above requirements, you can gather information on your subject machines with the following command:

```
<path-to-machine-stats>/windows/runner.ps1 -NoWinRM
```

Note that this does not collect CPU utilization by default. To include point-in-time CPU utilization in your result, use the following command:

```
<path-to-machine-stats>/windows/runner.ps1 -NoWinRM -CPUUtilizationOnlyValue -CPUUtilizationTimeout 1
```

As with the default behavior, this approach can be used with Tidal Tools, both in a single invocation or running in a scheduled task to gather information over time. You can upload the result file to Tidal Tools, or pipe the result directly, as covered in [this section](#running-the-script). 

### How Many Subjects Can I Scan At Once?

The short answer is that this depends on how you plan to run Machine Stats. If you plan to gather data over time by running Machine Stats on a scheduled job, then particular care needs to be taken choosing the number of subject machines a single controller machine can scan.

This is because under our testing conditions, we have found that the main limiting factor on the number of subjects that Machine Stats for Windows can scan at once is the period of time between scheduled job invocations.

In other words, if you want to invoke your scheduled job every 5 minutes, you need to ensure that the program can complete its scan of your desired number of subject machines within this 5 minutes. If the scan is still running when the next invocation occurs, that scan will fail.

Testing on virtual machines in AWS, we found that a t3.micro instance (full stats below) can scan roughly 250 subject instances safely in 5 minutes. This is the case when using WinRM, and also the [WMI approach](#gather-machine-stats-without-winrm) (`-NoWinRM`). If youâ€™d like to invoke Machine Stats more frequently, for example in 3 minute intervals, you may need to target fewer subjects per controller machine.

If on the other hand you are gathering general information on your servers and need to invoke Machine Stats for Windows only once, we found that an AWS t3.micro instance can scan 800 subject instances in around 15 minutes.

This is intended as a general guide, and your mileage may vary. If you want to run Machine Stats on a scheduled job, we encourage you to perform preliminary tests to determine the number of subject machines your controller machine can safely handle within your invocation period.

__AWS t3.micro__
- vCPUs: 2
- Clock Speed: 3.1 GHz
- RAM (GB): 1
- RAM Type: DDR4
- Network burst bandwidth (Gbps): 5

## Unix-like systems

### Introduction

Machine Stats for Unix-like Systems leverages [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to
gather facts in a cross-platform way.

### Requirements and Dependencies

Prior to the steps on syncing your Unix/Linux machines, be sure to have the below
dependencies setup:

- If you want to upload the results of running Machine Stats to the Tidal Migrations Platform, you will need to be on a server which is connected to the internet and has Tidal Tools installed. You can check out
  [Getting Started with Tidal Tools](tidal-tools.html) guide on how to install
  it.
- You need to install **Python 3.6+** on your local workstation (control node)
  and **Python 2.6+** or **Python 3.5+** on the machines you need to gather
  stats from (managed nodes). Please refer to the Machine Stats for Unix-like
  systems [technical
  documentation](https://github.com/tidalmigrations/machine_stats/blob/master/unix/README.md)
  for installation instructions.

### Creating the Hosts File

1. Create a file named `hosts` in the current directory.

2. Add connection strings in the form of `ssh-user@ip-address` or
   `ssh-user@domain` to the `hosts` file, one per line. If the `ssh-user@` part
   is omitted, then the current user name is used.

3. If you need to use a custom SSH identity file for some particular host,
   provide it as the following:

    ```
    my-user@example.com ansible_ssh_private_key_file=path/to/key-file.pem
    ```

### Run Machine Stats

Now that you have created a hosts file, you have three options for how to run Machine Stats depending on your needs. You can run the program manually and save the output to a result file. You could use Machine Stats to capture data points on your inventory and send its output to your Tidal workspace. Finally, You can use Machine Stats to capture statistics on a host for a period of time. The following 3 sections will guide you through these scenarios.
#### Execute Machine Stats Manually

Execute `machine-stats` in your current working directory, and save the result to a `json` file of your choice.

This is useful for performing a test run to ensure you have Machine Stats set up correctly, or for saving the results of a single invocation when running Machine Stats on an offline server.

    $ machine-stats > <path-to-result-file>

On an online server with `tidal tools` installed, you can upload this result file to Tidal Migrations Platform with the following command.

    $ tidal sync servers <path-to-result-file>

#### Pipe Machine Stats Output to Tidal Migrations Platform 

Execute `machine-stats` and pipe its output to Tidal Tools:

    $ machine-stats | tidal sync servers

This approach is useful when you want to take a snapshot of your infrastructure and upload it directly to the Tidal Migrations Platform in one command. Since we're uploading the result immediately, this approach will only work on a server which has `tidal tools` installed and which is connected to the internet.

#### Run Machine Stats on a Cron Job

By leveraging cron, you can run Machines Stats on a schedule to gather data over a period of time. This is useful if you want to gather utilization data, for example recording the CPU utilization of your machines over a set period.

Since we're not piping the result to Tidal Migrations Platform, and are instead saving the result files locally, this approach can be used on an offline server.

First, create a script for cron to execute, like the one below. Replace `<path-to-hosts-file>` and `<path-to-results-directory>` with the correct values. Ensure you use full paths, not relative paths. Save this script with a name like `run-machine-stats.sh`.

    #!/bin/bash

    timestamp_start=$(date +%T)
    machine-stats <path-to-hosts-file> > <path-to-results-directory>/result-${timestamp_start}.json

Make the script executable by anyone, so that cron can execute it.

    $ chmod +x <full-path-to-working-directory>/run-machine-stats.sh

Next, open a crontab with `crontab -e`. Copy the following into your crontab.

    PATH=<full-path>
    */5 * * * * bash <full-path-to-working-directory>/run-machine-stats.sh

You can get the value for `<full-path>` by running `echo $PATH`.

The `*/5` means that cron will execute this script every 5 minutes. You can customize this to set the sampling interval of your choosing. 

Your results should appear in the existing `<path-to-results-directory>` that you specified in the `run-machine-stats.sh` script. Each result filename will contain a timestamp of when the invocation occurred.

### Recommended Specs

Under our testing conditions, we have found that Machine Stats for Unix requires the following specifications of the controller machine. This is intended as a general guide only, as all testing was performed on virtual machines in AWS. Your mileage may vary scanning on-premise servers on your network.

__< 250 Subjects__

When scanning fewer than 250 subject machines, we recommend a controller machine with the following minimum specifications:
- vCPUs: 2
- Clock Speed: 3.1 GHz
- RAM (GB): 2
- RAM Type: DDR4

__250 - 800 Subjects__

When scanning up to 800 subject machines, we recommend a controller machine with the following minimum specifications:
- vCPUs: 4
- Clock Speed: 2.5 GHz
- RAM (GB): 16
- RAM Type: DDR4

__> 800 Subjects__

We cannot guarantee the success of Machine Stats for Unix when scanning more than 800 subject machines. If you need to operate at this scale, we recommend sharding your inventory into smaller groups and using multiple controller machines.
