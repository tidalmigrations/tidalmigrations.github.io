In Tidal Accelerator, you can save complex queries built with our advanced filtering system to your inventory dashboard. Queries can include filters, as well as search values and tags. 

For example, you may want to track all applications in the 'production' environment that have a complete transition plan but have not yet been migrated. You can save this as a query, so that you can apply this query with a single click whenever you'd like, rather than needing to manually filter for these values each time you want to work with this subset of applications.

You can then take this further by creating multiple dashboards and sharing them with your other team members.

## Creating Queries

You can create queries for applications, servers and databases.

From the Dashboard, click 'New Query' and select a record type.

<br>

You will be taken to the record page, with the advanced filter sidebar open. Here you can build your query by selecting filters. Note that queries allow you to save all configuration from a record view, so you can also set a search value, as well as tags.

To save, click 'Save Filter' in the bottom right of the filter drawer. Give this query a name and select a dashboard to save it to.

{% include image.html file="create-queries-3.PNG" %}
<br>

Navigate back to the dashboard page, and you will see your query saved as a card listing the filters that are applied, as well as the search value and tags (if you have set them).

## Creating Dashboards

You will have a 'main' dashboard by default, but you can also create new named dashboards. Click on the '+' button next to the 'main' dashboard tab.

{% include image.html file="create-dashboards-1.PNG" %}
<br>

Set the dashboard name and click 'Submit', and this dashboard will now be available as a tab.

## Sharing Dashboards

You can share any of your dashboards with others in the same workspace. They will have access to these dashboards, but will not be able to edit or delete them. 

To share a dashboard, navigate to the dashboard you'd like to share and click the 'Share Dashboard' button.

{% include image.html file="share-dashboards-1.PNG" %}
<br>

Select a user you'd like to share this dashboard with and click 'Submit'. This user will receive a notification, and the dashboard will appear for them to use.
