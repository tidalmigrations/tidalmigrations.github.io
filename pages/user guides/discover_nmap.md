As part of your cloud migration journey it is important to have all the tools at your disposal. In addition to [the other discovery methods](https://guides.tidalmg.com), you can use [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) to facilitate a part of the discovery process. 
The way it works is very simple and with the full power of nmap available to you, discovery of even those hard to reach places is possible. 
 
Nmap has developed some powerful capabilities and good [documentation](https://nmap.org/book/host-discovery-find-ips.html) that will allow you to identify  all the hosts you have running on your network, the ports and services that they have exposed and even some vulnerabilities discovered by the open source community. 
 
Nmap is capable of producing its output in an XML file, allowing you to inspect the raw scan output before sending it to the Tidal Migrations API with our CLI,  [Tidal Tools](https://get.tidal.sh). Once uploaded to the Tidal Migrations Platform, you will be able to visualize your network devices, track your complete server inventory and build on this data with other discovery methods, allowing you to make informed decisions on your cloud migration path.


## Using Nmap with Tidal Tools
 
By leveraging the power of **Tidal Tools** you can send the output generated by Nmap to Tidal migration API.
 
1. Install [Tidal Tools](https://guides.tidalmg.com/tidal-tools.html)
2. [Login to Tidal Tools](https://guides.tidalmg.com/tidal-tools.html#login) with **tidal login**
3. Run Nmap ([Need to install Nmap?](#installing-nmap)) with the flags of your choosing and save the output to an XML file. For example, 
```
sudo nmap -sS -p80,443,8080,8443,1433,1521,27017 <ip-address> -oX my-network.xml
```
Note: the **-sS** flag will enable TCP SYN port scan and the **-oX** specifies the output as a XML file.

4. Run this Tidal Tools command to upload your previously generated Nmap output to your Tidal Migrations account 
```
tidal sync nmap <filename.XML> 
``` 
 
5. Head over to your Tidal Migrations account!
 


## Installing Nmap

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
 
You can find all the documentation in its official site [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) and instructions for how to download based on your environment [download](https://nmap.org/download.html)


## Nmap usage

Nmap offers a wide range of utilities and commands, such as Port scanning, Host discovery, Service and version detection to name a few. Here some basic examples for how to do some nmap scanning.
 
_NB: Some commands required sudo privilege._
 
- Target Specification
 
```
nmap 192.168.1.1-254                # Scan a range
 
```
 
- Scan Techniques
 
```
nmap 192.168.1.1 -sS                # TCP SYN port scan (Default)
 
nmap 192.168.1.1 -sT                # TCP connect port scan (Default without root privilege)
 
nmap 192.168.1.1 -sU                # UDP port scan
 
```
 
- Host Discovery
 
```
nmap 192.168.1.1-3 -sL              # No Scan. List targets only
 
nmap 192.168.1.1/24 -sn             # Disable port scanning. Host discovery only.
 
nmap 192.168.1.1-5 -Pn              # Disable host discovery. Port scan only.
```
