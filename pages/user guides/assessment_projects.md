# Assessment Projects

During your migration to the cloud, you might find yourself in charge of dozens or hundreds of applications. At Tidal Migrations, we have found it invaluable to segment our applications into groups for 3 reasons:

1. It allows you to easily track your assessment progress and report items like financial highlights, project goals, and projected savings  to project managers or sponsors.
1. Segmenting applications into projects you help to make sure that the needs and purpose of an assessment are aligned in terms of timelines or goals.
1. It helps breakdown a large migration project into several manageable chunks that can be parallelized and operated on by different teams.


You can find the projects page under the home section in the menu.

## Creating a project

When you first visit `https://<your-subdomain>.tidalmg.com/#/projects`, it looks pretty barren.

However, _you_ can fix that! You can plant the seeds that will lead your orchard of projects to grow into a beautiful forest that will reach the clouds. To start, to plant your first seedling, you will need to click the `Create new project` button in the `Add Project` section found at the top of the page.

You will then be brought to a new page that allows you to set out some goals for your new project. This page includes settings for your timelines and financials, target cloud providers, the primary focus of your project, the project sponsor, and the guiding vision for the project.

It's OK to skip the fields you are unsure about. You can always come back to this page and adjust the details as things evolve.


## Overview

Once you've set some goals and added some apps to your projects, you've laid a solid foundation to migrate your first set of applications to the cloud.

The top of this page has now changed, we've added a new section that gives you quick insight into the most recently updated project. We only have one project now, but as your portfolio grows, you will be able to easily keep track of where exactly each project is at in the assessment process. This section highlights the progress, timeline of the project, and gives you access to dive into the rest of the project's details.

Clicking the details button above causes a section to pop up on the right side of the screen that highlights some important information about your project. Alternatively, you can open up any project's details section by clicking the row for that project in the table.

Here you can see more information, around the finances, timelines, and project goals.

Additionally, you can view the project by the transition types you have chosen for your applications.

## Insights

Finally, after filling in all the information about your project and adding some applications to it, you can get a birds eye view of your project by clicking on the green Projects Insights button.

This will lead you to our insights page, where you can get an overview of your financial highlights, assessment overview, migration ROI, application resource utilization, security vulnerabilities, and technology breakdown.
