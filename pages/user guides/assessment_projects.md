# Assessment Projects

During your migration to the cloud, you might find yourself in charge of dozens or hundreds of applications. At Tidal Migrations, we have found it invaluable to segment our applications into groups. Tidal's Project feature enables users to group applications by a common set of goals or timelines.

The projects page is found under the home section in the menu.

## Creating a project

When you first visit https://<your-subdomain>.tidalmg.com/#/projects, it looks pretty barren.

However, _you_ can fix that! First, you can plant the seeds that will lead your garden of projects to grow into a beautiful forest that will reach the clouds. to start, to plant your first seed, you will need to click the `Create new project` button in the `Add Project` section found at the top of the page.

It's ok if you don't know everything about your garden just yet, you can always come back to this page and adjust the details as things evolve.


## Overview

Once you've set some goals and added some apps to your projects, you've laid a solid foundation to migrate your first set of applications to the cloud.

The top of this page has now changed, we've added a new section that gives you quick insight into most recently updated project. We only have one project now, but as your garden grows it helps to see how you and your team are tending to these projects. This section highlights the progress, timeline of the project, and gives you access to dive into the rest of the details of the project.
