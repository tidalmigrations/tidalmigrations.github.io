# Assessment Projects

During your migration to the cloud, you might find yourself in charge of dozens or hundreds of applications. At Tidal Migrations, we have found it invaluable to segment our applications into groups or projects.

The projects page can be found under the home section in the menu

## Creating a project

When you first visit <https://<your-subdomain>.tidalmg.com/#/projects>, it looks pretty barren.

However, <span class="underline">you</span> can fix that! You can plant the seeds that will lead your garden of projects to grow into a beautiful forest that will reach the clouds. So to start, to plant your first seed, you will need to click the `Create new project` button in the `Add Project` section found at the top of the page.

You will then be brought to a new page that allows you to set out some goals for your new project. The include setting your timelines and financials, target cloud providers, the primary focus of your project, the project sponsor (gardener), and the guiding vision for the project.

It's ok if you don't know everything about your garden just yet, you can always come back to this page and adjust the details as your garden evolves.


## Overview

Once you've set some goals and added some apps to your projects, you can watch your seedlings grow from the projects page.

The top of this page has now changed, we've added a new section that gives you quick insight into most recently updated project. We only have one project at the moment, but as your garden grows it helps to see how you and your team are tending to these projects. This section highlights the progress and timeline of the project and gives you access to dive into the rest of the details of the project as well.

Clicking the details button above causes a component to pop up on the right side of the screen that highlights some important information about your project. Alternatively, you can open up the component by clicking on the project in the table.

Here you can see more information, around the finances, timelines, and project goals.

Additionally, you can get a view into the project by the transition types you have chosen for your applications.


## Insights

Finally, after filling in all the information about your project and adding some applications to it, you can get a highlevel overview of your project by clicking on the green projects insights button.
