To help you get your Tidal Migrations discovery phase up and running, we've created a pre-configured virtual machine image. This VM has the latest Tidal software and dependencies installed for you, so you can focus on getting things done.

## Ubuntu 18.04

The Ubuntu-18.04-server-amd64 image comes with the latest version of [Tidal Tools](https://tidalmigrations.com/tidal-tools/) and [Machine Stats](https://pypi.org/project/machine-stats/) installed. To get started, download the Virtual Machine image from the link given below. You can import this OVA file into your VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. Use the following credentials to login.

```
Username: ubuntu
Password: tidal

The Virtual Machine image is built with the latest ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server image available from Ubuntu for AWS. You can locate the source AMI from [Ubuntu Cloud Image Finder](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/).
