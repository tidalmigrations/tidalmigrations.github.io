To help you get your Tidal Migrations discovery phase up and running, we've created a series of pre-configured virtual machines with common operating systems. These VMs have the latest Tidal software and dependencies installed for you, so you can focus on getting things done.

## Ubuntu 18.04

The Ubuntu-18.04-server-amd64 image comes with [Tidal tools](https://tidalmigrations.com/tidal-tools/) and [Machine Stats](https://pypi.org/project/machine-stats/) installed. To get started, download the Virtual Machine image from the link given below. You can import this OVA file into your VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. Use the following credentials for SSH.

```
Username: vagrant
Password: vagrant
```

The _server install_ images do not have a graphical user interface and are suitable for AMD64 or EM64T architecture-based systems. To know more about this image type, visit [Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/18.04.6/release/).
