To help you get your Tidal Migrations discovery phase up and running, we've created a pre-configured virtual machine image. This VM has the latest Tidal Migrations software and dependencies installed for you, so you can focus on getting things done.

## Ubuntu 18.04

The Ubuntu-18.04-server-amd64 image comes with the latest version of [Tidal Tools](https://tidalmigrations.com/tidal-tools/) and [Machine Stats](https://pypi.org/project/machine-stats/) installed. To get started, download the Virtual Machine image from the link given below. You can import this OVA file into your VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. Use the following credentials to login.

The Virtual Machine image is built with the latest ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server image available from Ubuntu for AWS. You can locate the source AMI from [Ubuntu Cloud Image Finder](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/).
