Tidal Migration's importer will guide you through mapping your columns to our fields,
create your own fields and even make associations between dependencies
if you have captured these.

You can import your Excel spreadsheets into Tidal Migrations by visiting:

``https://your_workspace.tidalmg.com/#/discover/import``


## Preparing your Spreadsheet

If you'd like to try the process itself but don't have a file yet, you can use this <a href="https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/tidal.assets/inventory_data.xlsx">sample spreadsheet</a>.

You should import your data in the following order:

1. Virtualization Clusters
2. Servers
3. Database Instances
4. Applications

This order is especially important if you are planning to import dependencies for your Databases and Applications.
Ie. If your Application has a dependency on a server, you need to have that server imported first for the dependency to be imported correctly.

{% include note.html content="You can always update a dependency after importing too."  %}

You should have one sheet or file per type of record.

There are several default columns values included for each record type, 
however if you have additional information on your inventory that would like to include, you can create custom fields for a record (Check step 3). 
Remember to add those fields before importing the data.

## How to import your data

1. Select the data type you wish to import.

    {% include image.html file="step0.PNG" %}

2. Select the sheet in your file that you want to import data from.

    {% include image.html file="step1.PNG" %}

3. Map the columns of your sheet to the fields from the drop down. If you have a column that is not present as a field and you want to import it, you can add that field.

    {% include image.html file="step2.PNG" %}

4. Click submit to import the data.

{% include note.html content="If you are importing applications, the _name_ field is required for each application in order to successfully import. For any of the other record types you are importing, there are no fields that are required in order for you to import them." %}

{% include tip.html content="The Tags option can be used to generate multiple tags and associate them with the record. You can use this track any type of categorical data. Additionally you can search and filter for records based on tags. Multiple tags can be associated based on one column of data, they are parsed and split on any commas (,)" %}

### Importing Virtualization Clusters

Default fields:
- Hypervisor Technology
- Servers

There are no required fields when importing Virtualization clusters. 

* _Hypervisor Technology_, this specifies the technology that is used to run the hypervisor. Ex. VMware ESXi, Hyper-V. 

* _Servers_, As you import other records, (ex. Applications, Databases) this field is used to find the correct Server and create those dependencies.

    {% include note.html content="Make sure your server inventory (when importing virtual servers) contains a field `Cluster` that points back to the Virtualization Cluster it is part of." %}



### Importing Servers

There are no required fields when importing Servers. 

Default fields:
- Host Name (*)
- FQDN
- Assigned ID
- Zone
- Role
- RAM Allocated (GB)
- RAM Used (GB)
- CPU Count
- CPU Name
- Storage Allocated (GB)
- Storage Used (GB)
- Description
- IP Addresses -> Address (*)
- Database Instances -> Name (*)
- Environment -> Name (*)
- Cluster -> Host Name (*)
- Tags
- Operating System Version
- Operating System


**(*)** Associative fields.
* _Host Name_, This field is used to identify the server and to create association with Databases, Applications, and Virtualization Clusters.
* _Cluster -> Host Name_, If a server is a Virtual Server, this field should match the value from the _Servers_ field in the Virtualization Cluster inventory. The **cluster host name** field is be used create the necessary association with its Virtual Cluster and its physical host.
* _Database Instances -> Name_, If a server is hosting a Database (or multiple), this field should contain the **name**(s) of such database(s).
* _Environment -> Name_, This field is used to represent the server's environment.



### Importing Databases

There are no required fields when importing Databases.

Default fields:
- Name (*)
- Description
- Database Size (MB)
- Database Path
- Server -> Host Name (*)
- Environment -> Name (*)
- Tags

**(*)** Associative fields.
* _Name_, When you are importing other records, Applications and Servers, and you provide a set of dependent databases with them the Name field for Database Instances is used to identify those databases and associate the databases as dependencies for those other records. This is helpful when you have some existing dependencies, between Databases and Servers or Applications, in your Excel files and want to capture and leverage them.
* _Server -> Host Name_, represents the server hosting a Database. This field should contain the **Host Name** of such server.
* _Environment -> Name_, This field is used to associate a Database to an environment.


### Importing Applications

When importing Applications, only the **Name** field is required.

Default fields:
- Name
- Description
- URLs
- Source Code Location
- Total Users
- Revenue
- Annual Hosting Costs
- Annual Staff Costs
- Uptime Requirements
- Data Sensitivity
- Frequency Of Deployments
- PII
- Legal Holds
- COTS
- Source Code Controlled
- Continuous Delivery
- Business Continuity Plan
- Can Run On Linux
- End Of Support Date
- Servers -> Host Name (*)
- Database Instances -> Name (*)
- Environment -> Name (*)
- Customers
- Tags
- Technical Lead
- Business Owner

**(*)** Associative fields.
 However, in order to properly map your inventory you must use the following fields.
* _Servers -> Host Name_, represents the server hosting the Application. This field should contain the **Host Name** of such server(s).
* _Database Instances -> Name_, This field should contain the **Name** of the database(s) associated to the Application.
* _Environment -> Name_, This field is used to associate an Application to an environment.
