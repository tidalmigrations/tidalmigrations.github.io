Tidal Accelerator streamlines your cloud migration workflow by enabling powerful bulk operations across your portfolio. You can manage multiple records at once - from assigning servers to applications in bulk, to copying values across multiple applications, and consolidating environments. These bulk operations help you maintain consistency and save time when working with large application portfolios during your migration journey.

## Bulk Editing Applications, Servers and Databases

When working with Applications, Server or Databases, you might need to apply changes to multiple records at once. This process works the same way for all three record types, but for the purposes of this guide we'll work with Applications.

From the Applications view, select the checkboxes for the records you'd like to edit. You can use the search bar to narrow down your selection by name or tag.

For this example, say we have some new information and we'd like to update the technical lead for all apps with the tag 'Group 1'. 

{% include image.html file="edit-apps-1.png" %}

After making your selection, open the 'Bulk Actions' dropdown and select 'Edit'

{% include note.html content="You must click the checkbox for each record you plan to edit, rather than clicking the 'select all' checkbox at the top of the checkbox role." %}

{% include image.html file="edit-apps-2.png" %}

In the drawer, enter the values for the field or fields that you'd like to change. For our example, we'll set 'Technical Lead' to 'Addie Stroman'.

{% include image.html file="edit-apps-3.png" %}

Next, click 'Submit', and your changes will be applied to your selected records.
